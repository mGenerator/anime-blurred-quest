Bugs: 
  Visual Glitch: 1-3-25 
    Something is affecting the margin and content size to increase/decrease after click submit guess 
    The margin decreases, and the width of the container increases overall 
    Not sure what element is causing the elements to shift but I assume its due to addition of the feedback text. Will see if theres a way to compensate for that, likely with the addition fo a css style via a classlist add method later.
